        <p class="subtitle-text">I didn't know dental trucks existed until this day. Dallas County Dental Society had partered with another organization to serve the community of Garland and Sachse. It was windy and freezing cold that day, so patients had to wait in their cars. I learned that the dental truck, with its two operatories, costed about one million dollars. The truck had three rooms and was actually very spacious. One patient in particular stuck with me. He required a molar extraction; he told the doctor that he trusted him completely to do whatever was needed. The procedure was much quicker than I expected, and afterwards Dr. commented on how empowering/rewarding it felt to have the patient's full faith in him. </p>

    <section class="second-section">
        <p class="subtitle-text">Dr. D introduced me to TeamSmile, a sport-based organization that travels around the United States setting up mobile dental clinics for children. Because they visit Texas every once in a while, I was fortunate enough to have the chance to volunteer with them at Globe Life Field in Arlington. I couldn't help but notice how beautiful the mobile units were. It looked like a huge treasure chest on wheels. The dental unit itself could slide in and out of the chest. It was so magical and truly a testament to the power of volunteer dentistry.</p>

    <section class="second-section">
        <p class="subtitle-text">Last Writers is a unique program that gives students the chance to interview hospice patients and create a living memoir! I completed mine in spring of sophomore year and continued with the organization as a mentor and fundraising chair. My experience with LW opened my eyes to the resilience of the human body and mind. I'l forever be grateful for the chance to have gotten a glimpse into the 98 and counting years of another person's life. The writing process was very fulfilling as it allowed me to oversee my project from start to finish, personalizing the book for my patient and her family. This reminded me one of the reasons why I chose dentistry: the ability to orient patient care in a way that prioritizes their experience.</p>
