        <p class="subtitle-text">TAMSOD was the first dental school I toured. Their Impressions Day was hosted by SNDA. They planned a variety of hands-on activities such as waxing, drilling, composite filings, and more. I listened to lectures by admissions officials and an open Q&A session with a dentist panel. The dentist who extracted my wisdom teeth was one of the speakers! I was also able to gain a better feel of TAMSODâ€™s campus. This event was the most memorable out of the three pre-dental events I attended in the spring. I felt the most connected to the people and it helped reaffirm TAMSOD as one of my top dental schools. </p>

        <p class="subtitle-text">UTSD's Impressions Day was also hosted by SNDA. One thing that stood out to me about the school was its beautiful campus. The spirit of the students and faculty were apparent in the school's decor. They even had a designated tooth room! A good amount of UTD students were also able to make it down to Houston, so it was nice seeing familiar faces.</p>

        <p class="subtitle-text">UTHSCSA's Pre-Dental Day was hosted by ASDA. I participated in activities similar to those at previous Impressions days. I gained a better feel of the school and appreciated their strive for excellence in terms of training competent dentists. This time, my family came with me, and we were able to visit the nearby Japanese Garden the morning after the event.</p>
