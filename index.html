        <p>I'm currently a third-year student at the <b>University of Texas at Dallas</b>. I'm majoring in Biology with a minor in Secondary Science Education.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm applying for dental school in the 2025-2026 application cycle (AH!). When I'm not studying or working, I like to volunteer, scrapbook, get crafty, sing karaoke or try new foods!</p>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of creating things (a major part of why I'm interested in dentistry!), so I made this website to chronicle my undergraduate years (and hopefully my dental school years as well). Join me on my <b>pre-dental journey</b>!</p>

    <h1 class="header2">A bit about me</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas, and I have a sister who is 2.5 years younger than me. We're like two peas in a pod. I'm obsessed with the color pink, and my favorite movie is Ratatouille because of its inspiring theme: "Anyone can cook!" While I'm not entirely sure what my favorite food is, I think it might be mangos or salmon. My family is the most important thing in the world to me! They immigrated to the United States about 30 years ago due to the Vietnam War. I've always admired their perseverance and have drawn inspiration from it in everything I do. This has helped me appreciate the beauty in hardship, which is one of the main reasons I'm interested in dentistry.
    <p> Growing up in a household so rich with history and culture gave me a deep sense of community that I have to come to greatly value. It is this sense of connection that first drew me to healthcare, and ultimately dentistry. I grew up on stories of resilience. My grandpa detailed his time in prison after the fall of Saigon, exclaiming how he was so starved that he “ate whatever moved.” Afterwards, he resorted to smuggling others because he couldn’t find work after he got out.</p>
    <p> I listened to my mom reminisce about going to university in Texas, when a soft pretzel from Auntie Anne’s was considered a luxury and parking prices at UT Dallas had not even reached fifty dollars. Years later, she married the guy who would stop by the gas station where she worked to give her pretzels. Since 2000, my dad gave up his weekends to play guitar for extra income, always saying it was “so my girls can go shopping”. To this day, he still says the same thing. </p>
    <p> Although their lives were marked by sacrifice, my family gave everything to provide me and my sister a childhood of comfort and opportunity, encouraging us to use it as a foundation for our future endeavors. My parents are the embodiment of sacrifice, and they have inspired my love for human connection. These experiences helped me understand how powerful it is to show up for those around you. I’m not only driven by the desire to give back to those that raised me, but also to those that share similar stories of struggle and strength as hardworking immigrants.</p>
    <p>Growing up, science was my favorite subject because of how concrete and applicable it is, and this naturally led me toward healthcare. At first, I was drawn to medicine, captivated by the fast-paced environment of hospitals. However, I soon realized I desired more autonomy to affect change, so I pivoted to pharmacy, then to optometry. During my first year at university, I became heavily involved in UT Dallas's pre-optometry club and volunteered at free vision clinics and attended statewide optometric conferences to learn more about the field. However, I've always felt like something was missing. Everything changed when an unexpected job opportunity in dentistry came my way, leading me to finally switch my focus to dentistry. </p>

    <h1 class="header2">My Why</h1>
    <section class="first-section">
        <p> While there are many aspects of dentistry that I appreciate, one overarching theme connects most of my reasons for pursuing dentistry: the ability to connect and comfort patients in the most direct way. Working and volunteering as an RDA for the past 2.5 years has allowed me to immerse myself into the intricacies of dentistry. I deeply value the continuity of care that dentistry facilitates. I’ve had the privilege of following my own patients’ journeys at work—celebrating their newborn grandkids, college admissions, post-graduation paths and even inspiring some to consider dentistry!</p>
        <p>I admire how a collection of radiographs tells a story…and how dentists get to add to that story year after year. Dentists have the ability facilitate an environment of comfort and trust for every patient that enters the office simply due to the nature of the profession: it focuses on prevention and patient education, prioritizing patient choice.</p>
        <p> To sum everything up, my experiences have reinforced my belief in the power of dentistry to affect change, no matter how small. From allowing patients to stray from their treatment plan to providing free dental work to hundreds of patients at mass volunteer events, dentistry makes way for profound impacts and compassionate care, which drives my dedication to the field.</p>
