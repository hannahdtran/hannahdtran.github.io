        <p>I'm currently a third-year student at the <b>University of Texas at Dallas</b>. I'm majoring in Biology with a minor in Secondary Science Education.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm studying for my second DAT attempt in March and preparing to enter the spring semester of junior year. When I'm not studying or working, I like to volunteer, scrapbook, sing karaoke or try new foods!</p>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of creating things (a major part of why I'm interested in dentistry!), so I made this website to chronicle my undergraduate years. Join me on my <b>pre-dental journey</b>!</p>

    <h1 class="header2">A bit about me</h1>
    <p>I was born and raised in the suburbs of Dallas, Texas. I have a sister that is 2.5 years younger than me. My favorite color is pink. My favorite movie is Ratatouille because of its theme, "Anyone can cook!" I'm not too sure what my favorite food is, but I think it might be mangos. I have one sister that's 2.5 years younger than me. We're like two peas in a pod. My family immigrated to the United States about 30 years ago due to the Vietnam War. I've always admired their perserverance and used this as inspiration in the things I pursued. Thus, I grew to find beauty in hardship--it's a major reason I'm interested in dentistry!
    </p>
    <p>Growing up, my favorite subject was science because of how concrete and applicable it is. Because of this, I've gravitated towards healthcare since second grade. While the reasoning for this was pretty much baseless in elementary school, I grew to understand the intricacies of healthcare and began pondering different career options in high school. Initially, I was set on medicine, finding excitement in the fast-paced hospital environment. Wanting a better work-life balance, I pivoted to pharmacy, then to optometry. I began seriously pursuing optometry during my first year of university, becoming heavily involved in UTDallas's pre-optometry club and learning more about the field at statewide optometric conferences. I finally switched to dentistry when an unexpected opportunity fell into my lap. </p>
