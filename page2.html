        A loud metal clang jolted me back to reality. Disoriented by bright lights and incomprehensible voices, I suddenly heard Dr. H announce the procedure was done. That day, I walked out of the clinic with four missing premolars and a tainted view of dentistry, almost certain I would never want to facilitate such torment as a dentist. Ten years later, I’m back at the same clinic--not as a patient, but a provider. My path to dentistry began at the start of freshman year, when a position became available at my childhood dental clinic. Four years later, I’ve served thousands of patients, been on seven (and counting) dental missions, and traveled halfway around the world to serve my Vietnamese community. During my undergraduate years, I’ve observed how dentistry highlights the humanism of healthcare through its personalized patient care and how it allowed me to reconnect to my roots through tangible, meaningful work. Much like fragments in a mosaic, these chance encounters come together to shape my unique perspective of dentistry and solidify my commitment to the field.

        Working with low-income immigrant communities at Dr. H’s clinic allowed me to appreciate the individualized nature of dentistry. I was inspired by patients like Mr. V, a Mexican immigrant who faced his fear of the dentist with remarkable positivity. He always left the office with a smile and heartfelt gratitude for his restored teeth. Despite the language barrier, the hands-on process of dental care connected us. My curiosity was sparked when I met Mr. and Mrs. T, a Vietnamese couple who had only been living in the U.S. for a year. Believing that baby teeth would fall out eventually, they had never taken their eight-year-old daughter to the dentist. Unfortunately, her untreated decay had spread to her permanent teeth, creating a more complex problem. Over the next few weeks, I watched the smiles of these patients be restored visit-by-visit and admired how the role of a dentist highlights both long-term health and patient choice. These experiences deepened my appreciation for the resilience and trust of our patients, while also helping me improve my Vietnamese and dental Spanish!

        I began to appreciate how my cultural background allowed me to reach more people, a strength especially valuable within dentistry’s small-scale settings. I found myself lending an ear to patients’ stories, many of which mirrored those of my own family. I sought to expound on this niche and began volunteering at local missions. I fell in love with the concept of “healing hands” that dentistry facilitated. These mass volunteer events exemplified how quick yet substantial relief could be provided through simple procedures that eased pain and restored teeth as if decay had never existed. As a result, I felt called to return to my parents’ home country to complete an international mission.

        My week in rural central Vietnam after junior year opened my eyes to the transformative power of dentistry and the role of compassion within the field. In Pleiku, a mountainous region with its own language, I joined a team of Vietnamese professionals, American dentists, and local volunteers to treat nearly seven hundred patients in six days using seven small dental units. One moment profoundly shifted my worldview. Mrs. P., an elderly woman with multiple teeth on the verge of falling out, had her condition remedied with a simple injection and a swift pull. Afterward, she pointed to the balloons we were giving to children. Puzzled, I asked her, “Did you want one?” Her eyes lit up as she nodded, and my heart broke, realizing she might have never been in a position to receive something that I wouldn’t have glanced twice at. This trip helped me become more mindful of the invisible strings that have shaped my journey. Thirty years ago, my family fled war and rebuilt their lives from scratch. Now, I’m able to return to their homeland and give back to those whose perspectives I can never truly empathize with—a privilege I deeply cherish. My experiences in Vietnam reinforced my belief in dentistry’s transformative hand and how its ease of mass mobilization facilitates result-driven relief that has the potential to immediately improve patients’ ways of life.

        The chance interactions that make up my life mosaic have fostered a deep appreciation for the intimate nature of dentistry. I believe it is a profession truly rooted in the doctor-patient relationship. At its core, it relies on the honest conversation between dentist and patient, enhanced by personalized treatment plans and routine visits that nurture this relationship over time. Coupled with its capacity for large-scale volunteer mobilization, dentistry facilitates patient-centered care that distinctly aligns with my values and cultural experiences. The chance interactions with friends, family, mentors, and patients fuel my dedication to the profession in hopes of leaving a lasting impact on others’ life mosaics, just as they have on mine.
