        <p class="subtitle-text">I loved every second of my first mass volunteer mission event in Bonham, so I sought out other local mission opportunities. After an extensive online search, I came across Hand in Hand, a non-profit dedicated to providing healthcare services to underserved communities in the Dallas-Forth Worth area. I automatically asked off work and signed up for the event. Coincidentially, Dr. D was also planning on volunteering, and I was able to assist her again at a different mission! Hand in Hand has grown to be my most favorite organization to volunteer with because it gives me the chance to give back to those who look like me and those with stories I can resonate with. Because of this, I applied to join them on their international mission trip to central Vietnam the upcoming summer.</p>

        <p class="subtitle-text">My second mission with Hand in Hand occured after my international mission trip just a couple of months prior. I was able to reunite with many of the same people who I worked with in Vietnam, one of the highlights of that day. This event took place in Asia Times Square. It was the first time my sister came with me to a Hand in Hand local mission. One thing of the many things I took from my trip back to Vietnam was the need to "share your story" so that others could gain inspiration from it as well. For this reason, I wanted to introduce my sister to a community/opportunity I'm so passionate about.</p>
        <p class="subtitle-text">The dental office next-door gave up their clinic for the volunteers to work in. I noticed my bilingualism come in handy as I served as a translator, one of the reasons I love working with Hand in Hand so much. I felt I had found my "niche," a position that highlighted my strengths. We ended up staying later than expected due to a long wisdom tooth case. As always, I enjoyed meeting new people and assisting a variety of cases.</p>

        <p class="subtitle-text">This mission took place in Fort Worth, a few days after Christmas. I woke up at 6 AM since we had to arrive at 7:30 AM. It was pouring rain the entire day, but many patients still showed up to be treated. This mission was meant to serve the religious figures returning to Vietnam, so it was much shorter than normal missions. As expected, I dragged my sister along. Surprisingly, she got pulled from sterilization to assist hygiene!</p>
