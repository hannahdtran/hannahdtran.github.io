    <section class="second-section">
        <p class="subtitle-text">In July of 2024, I took a mission trip to central Vietnam with Hand in Hand. It was one of, if not the most, meaningful experience in my life because of the emotion it invoked and the insight I've gained serving the indigenous community of Pleiku. Providing dental care in my parents’ home country was an incredibly emotional experience. What struck me most was the bravery of the indigenous people, especially the children. Despite their limited access to dental care and the language barriers between us, they readily laid down in makeshift chairs to undergo intense cleanings, fillings, and extractions. This trip reminded of me of the defining reasons why I chose to pursue dentistry: the ease of volunteer mobilization and the privilege of earning a patient’s trust to perform result-driven care.</p>

        <p class="subtitle-text">During the first couple days of the mission, we visited local orphanages. A lot of the same kids showed up at our clinic the following days. We hosted separate clinics at two different churches, setting up and breaking down the clinic sites twice. The first couple days were pretty draining for me, and I fell asleep the moment my head hit the pillow each night.  </p>

        <p class="subtitle-text">One of the most special things that came out of this mission was the people! Being a part of a community working towards a similar goal was so empowering. To this day, it's still very puzzling to me how I was able to create such close bonds with strangers within a matter of days. It still I met so many people that have left a lasting mark in my memories. This trip embodied compassion in its purest form, and I'm very grateful to have been a part of that.</p>
